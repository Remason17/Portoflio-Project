      <h2 class= "text-center"> About me </h2>
 <p class= "text-center"> Since I was a child, I've always had a deep love for tech through video games and toys. It was then in High School, when I entered the Robotics program that I had finally found my passion. Learning to code inspired me to further pursue my passion which today has matured into a software engineering student at Thinkful! I am respectful, loyal, willing and hard-working. I would be a great fit at any Engineering firm/company.  </p>
